Kids Zone DayCare was founded in 1994 by Linda Parr and Judy Kleinjans.  Both are former school teachers.  Co-operatively they also ran Jack n' Jill preschool for 11 years.  Since 1986 they have taught hundreds of children and both have children and grandchildren of their own so they totally understand today's parenting issues.
