We are located on Business US-27 South of St. Johns, Michigan In 4 classrooms our highly qualified staff  focus on problem solving, decision making and self-help, while promoting interpersonal communications.  These are key elements which contribute to the child's development, self esteem and confidence. Kids Zone DayCare was founded in 1994 by Linda Parr and Judy Kleinjans.  Both are former school teachers.  Co-operatively they also ran Jack n' Jill preschool for 11 years.  Since 1986 they have taught hundreds of children and both have children and grandchildren of their own so they totally understand today's parenting issues. 4500 S. Business US-27, Saint Johns, Mi. 48879 ![](http://www.kzdaycare.com/files/QuickSiteImages/background-top.jpg)
